# SNVFormer

This repository contains the code from the 2022 ICML Computational biology workshop paper 'SNVformer: an attention-based deep neural network for GWAS data.'

`./train_create_paper_figures` runs the benchmarks in the paper.

N.B. A number of paths are hard-coded, and access to data from the UK BioBank is required to actually re-produce the results.
